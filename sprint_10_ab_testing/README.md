# A/B testing
In this scenario, I look at an A/B test for an online store. That's pretty much it, just make some charts and decide which, if either, group is better. Which is pretty usual for data analysis.

As you can see, the analysis is in a Jupyter notebook. The libraries used are NumPy, pandas, Plotly, SciPy, and seaborn.

After deciding which hypothesis deserves to get tested, a test is done (in principle; running the test itself isn't part of the analysis), and it's found that one group, which may be the test or the control group because this is properly blinded, is indeed clearly better.
