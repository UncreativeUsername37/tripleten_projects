    "## Recommendations\n",
    "### First of all, this isn't a situation of no hope\n",
    "Despite the overall stats, the whole general idea of advertising for the site is not necessarily a bad one. If it really is true about source 3 that it was totally saturated, that alone makes things look much better: if you make its costs for every month equal to the average of those for 2, 4, and 5 but keep the same visitors, seven of the last eight months are profitable, though still relying on the big purchases for that to be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to focus our creativity on\n",
    "The plot of visits and funding by source is pretty linear in general, suggesting that the marketing gets people to come to the site, that isn't the problem. What we need to come up with is how to get a good fraction of people to buy things once they're there. Getting people to stay after they've come for the first time also has a lot of room for improvement, and combined with a solution to the low conversion, that should change that not many people buy anything after their first few days.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The sources\n",
    "* Source 1 relies on bigger users a lot, but it's proven consistent, so there's no reason not to keep it.\n",
    "* Source 2 also has a huge reliance on big spenders, as shown by its bad CAC and its ROI when only counting \"normal\" spenders. It's got a lot better in the last few months, though. It might be good to keep it where it is for now and see if it keeps it up but also not be afraid to drop it.\n",
    "* Source 3 has found a limit and should be brought back to the moderate level some of the others were at, around 50k a year, for proper evaluation.\n",
    "* Even though it mostly hasn't been profitable, source 4 knows how to bring people in, and if we do figure out the above problems, it could end up being the best one. Maybe suspend it until we're better at converting, but certainly don't forget about it.\n",
    "* Source 5 is iffy on visits, okay but not great on users, and middling on actual ROI (and look how much of it was from a single month). It's closer to bad than good, and if we improve the overall situation, it might turn out to be okay, but if we're looking to drop something, it won't be a terrible choice. Maybe drop it for now and bring it back for another chance if or when things improve in general.\n",
    "* Source 9 has encouraging stats and should be given a proper chance. Like source 3, it should get a medium amount of funding.\n",
    "* Over the year this analysis is about, source 10 seems good at attracting a lot of users and even users who convert, but apparently not ones willing to spend much. In the past three months it's been noticeably better, but that's true for most of the sources. I wouldn't abandon hope, but maybe keep it small for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering how closely visits and advertising are correlated, steadily increasing the budget in general until the returns diminish will be a good idea, *after* we find profitability with the whole endeavour in the first place."
