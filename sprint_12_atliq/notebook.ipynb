    "## Conclusions\n",
    "First off, all of these products are good. There's no reason to get rid of or lift off the throttle on any of them. Even though the Mforce Gen X does amusingly bad in the comparisons, it still makes plenty of money. As for which is the best or what should be promoted particularly hard, perhaps the Dracula. It didn't have the same rise as the other HDDs, but surely you can put that down to some of the versions disappearing. If those hypothetical sales didn't go to other Dracula variants, the product feels like it should be higher because the absent ones had been selling just fine, and if some sales did, that makes it feel like it was underpromoted or otherwise underrecommended and again \"should have\" been the most popular in late 2021. Or maybe the build quality or reputation took a hit. With the way it happened right before that huge rise got started, plus without any kind of advertising data, it isn't possible to know, but these numbers are big enough that there's got to be some reason behind it all. Again, assuming there isn't a big chunk of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There aren't any notable regional differences except for the LATAM bump. To be honest, it probably is just how small it is in terms of customers and income making for funny numbers, or it could just be early days of COVID-19 affecting different areas differently – we do have to remember that with this timespan, pretty much every conclusion has a COVID-19 asterisk on it – but it is a deviation from what every other year in every other area has, so it is worth looking into what was going on there at that time or if there was something different being done. As for categories, the hard drives did better than the graphics card, but it's hard to say it means anything with a total of four products compared, even before the matter of the disappearing variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that is a matter to look into. The Standard 3 variant of the Mforce Gen X has a much higher sales total than the others seemingly because it was the only one not discontinued mid-2020, but why? The others were selling just as well. Same deal for the Dracula."
