# WHO suicide dataset analysis
Using the data that can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/suicide-dataset, after a bit of cleaning, I made a bunch of Plotly scatterplots in an attempt to find which factors matter the most. Python 3.9, pandas, and Plotly is all the notebook uses. Theoretically, a version of this with more factors, and more up to date data, and a type of analysis that cares about interdependent factors more, could be used to decide what kinds of things should get more funding.

Spoiler: the best thing you can do is have more professional psychiatrists.

As of the time of writing, the web app that was made as part of the assignment still works too: https://practicum-s6.onrender.com/. If you want to see the app locally, you can clone this and install Streamlit and streamlit run app.py on whatever Python command line.
