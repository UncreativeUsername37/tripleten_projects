# AtliQ Hardware
This is mainly product analysis on just four products. Thus, even though the products have them, there are no categories or such being compared, it's just the individual products and some variants within them, though the variants turn out to all be quite similar saleswise.

As you can see, the analysis is in a Jupyter notebook. The libraries used are pandas, Plotly, SciPy, and SQLite3. You'll have to unzip atliq_db.rar into the same folder as the notebook. There's also a dashboard in Tableau using the same data.

One product is found to probably have more sales potential than the others, but variants dropping out along the way complicates things.
