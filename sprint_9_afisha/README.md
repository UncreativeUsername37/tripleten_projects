# Yandex.Afisha analysis
Data on visits to the site Yandex.Afisha and orders that were made on it, covering the period June 2017 to May 2018, is used to find out how people use the site. Along with a table of marketing spend by source by day, this informs an analysis of which of those sources deserve more or less of this funding.

As you can see, the analysis is in a Jupyter notebook. The libraries used are Matplotlib, NumPy, pandas, Plotly, SciPy, and seaborn.

It turns out most people visit once and never again, and even most people who buy something only ever do it once. Certain sources are found to be more efficient than others in terms of CAC and ROI.
